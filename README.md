This code find modular multiplicative inverse of an integer a.
In the standard notation of modular arithmetic this congruence is written as ax=1(mod m).
The first input is a, which cannot be less than zero.
The second input is m which cannot be greater than 10^9.
If the modular multiplicative inverse does not exist the algorithm outputs 0.
